<b>INFM 600 </b>

This is the dataset created for the INFM600 Information Discovery and Analysis assignment

<b> Version </b> 1.0 (March 19th 2016)

<b> Description </b>

The datasets have been retrieved from www.kaggle.com, and they indicate the rankings of the best universities in the world.

<b>Data analysis</b>

From the original datasets, we have retained only the necessary data required to merge, and answer a research question and hypothesis. Our merged dataset is the times_shanghai_mergedRankings.xlsx file created by merging data from shanghaiData.csv with the focal dataset, timesData.csv. The detailed step-by-step procedure of how this file was created can be found on the URL https://github.com/aditi-sharma/INFM-600---Information-Discovery-and-Analysis in the ‘Processing Documentation.pdf ‘ file
This dataset can be used to answer following research question and hypothesis:
1. Determine if there is a correlation between the world rank of a university and its award and citations score
2. Analyze the hypothesis that higher the amount of international students in a university, higher would be the world rank of the university.

The results for the above question and hypothesis have been answered using the tool SPSS in the ‘Data analysis of merged dataset.pdf ‘ file at the URL https://github.com/aditi-sharma/INFM-600---Information-Discovery-and-Analysis
